### Probot-Apps-Summary
You can follow my work in the Probot framework here. I will be summarizing information about all the applications I create in this repository.

The first application I created in Probot commented on newly filed issues. The repository for this application can be found [here](https://github.com/svensevenslow/My-first-probot-app)

The second application I created provides an @mention to the repository owner in a commment whenever a new issue is filed, requesting for labels to be added. Whenever a label is added the user who filed the issue is informed with an @mention in a comment. The repository for this application can be found [here](https://github.com/svensevenslow/Mentions)

I test all my Github applications on [this](https://github.com/svensevenslow/ProbotTesting) repository.

Still thinking of some other cool ideas. I'll keep on updating.
